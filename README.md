# Community Governance

This is the home of the Grupo da Causa Humana community. The main goal of this group of friends is to discuss, develop and research technological challenges current faced by society.

Grupo da Causa Humana is a group idealized by researchers, professor and friends, which study and discuss ideas in a health, peaceful and sustainable environment.
Different contributions are achieving from a diverse group, composed of people with different backgrounds, goals, dreams and personal beliefs.

Although this community is neither a private company nor any legal formal organization, we intend to use it for providing a formal structure to embrace scientific projects faced on society.

The city of Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil, is the hearth of the foundation of our team.
